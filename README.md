# Nifty-Stock-Market-Data
About Dataset
The primary objective of this project is to calculate the Nifty index value using various independent variables such as DJI, VIX, SP500, Brent Crude oil, USD-INR, and CBOE. Following the estimation of the Nifty value, we will then use this data to predict the values of individual stocks. The dataset is tailored to provide a comprehensive understanding of how global news impacts financial markets and to enable hands-on experience with real-world data for deep learning and ML applications.
